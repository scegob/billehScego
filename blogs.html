        <h2><a href="https://medium.com/p/b2a03b1f1977" target="_blank">Erik Erikson: Exploring the Stages of Psychosocial Development and why it is important.</a></h2>
        <p>
            Erik Erikson is one of my favorite psychologists. 
            His profound insights into human development have had a lasting impact on my thought process. 
            Erikson’s theory of psychosocial development deepened our understanding of the complex interactions between social dynamics and human development, going beyond the scope of merely biological and psychological processes.

            What question(s) do you think the site exists to answer?
            The website provides information about features, pricing, compatibility, and effective usage of Microsoft’s products and services. 
            It responds to inquiries regarding software updates, technical problems, troubleshooting, and offers resources for customers looking for assistance with Microsoft products.

        <h2><a href="https://medium.com/p/43a8bf3f6f4a" target="_blank">Gamifying Weight Loss: How Pokemon Go Can Motivate You to Shed Pounds.</a></h2>
        <p>
            Niantic is a world renowned for augmented reality also known as AR and on their homepage they have a goal for AR to improve people’s life, “What if augmented reality could make us better? 
            Could it nudge us off the couch for a Saturday in the park?”. 
            Besides the augmented reality, the thing I like about this application is how it tracks your steps weekly and gives you rewards and incentives through how many miles you walk. 
            You can find pokemon and collect items at stops in different locations and the only way to move in the game is by walking. This gamification of healthy activities has really been pivotal for my weight loss and I know that it can do the same for others.

            <h2><a href="https://medium.com/p/2a875b78e965" target="_blank">Beyond Standardization: Challenging Notions of a ‘Standard’ Human in Science and Healthcare.</a></h2>
            <p>
                The “Politics of Science” course last year was one of my favorites. 
                This course examined the complex interrelationship between politics and scientific progress, examining how political issues affect scientific discoveries and the applications that follow. 
                We engaged in fascinating debates and looked at thought-provoking case studies throughout the semester, which helped me to better appreciate the dynamic relationship between science and society.

                <p>
                    Failure is a necessary component to success, and this is a fact that many people are afraid to acknowledge because it will require change that they are not willing to make. 
                    This approach aligns with the concept of a Growth Mindset, where setbacks are viewed as opportunities for improvement rather than insurmountable obstacles.
